Today, I formally served Substack Inc. with a detailed Cease and Desist notice. In direct communications, Substack has explicitly confirmed its intentional and selective suppression of my scholarly content from indexing by external search engines, notably Google. This covert practice severely restricts visibility, citations, readership, and professional opportunities, deliberately interfering with my scholarly and economic interests.

Substack’s actions constitute not only intentional interference under California law but also breach explicit and implied contractual obligations set forth in Substack’s own Terms of Use. Substack explicitly promises authors control over their content, including freedom to publish openly and without mandatory monetisation or indexing restrictions. Substack’s selective suppression violates both these explicit commitments and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in every contractual agreement under California law.

Moreover, Substack’s deliberate suppression breaches voluntarily assumed fiduciary obligations—not only toward individual authors but also toward the broader scholarly community, society at large, and the very integrity of open and democratic discourse. Such selective suppression breaches explicit obligations of transparency, fairness, good faith, impartiality, and fiduciary openness.

I suspect that many other Substack authors, particularly those publishing scholarly or publicly accessible content without a paywall, may unknowingly be victims of similar covert indexing suppression. This systematic misconduct suggests grounds for potential class-action litigation to collectively pursue transparency, fiduciary accountability, contractual adherence, and comprehensive remedial measures.

If you publish scholarly content on Substack, I urge you to verify your discoverability by searching Google using:

```
site:your-substack-name.substack.com
```

If your content is missing or severely limited in search results, you may have experienced similar suppression.

Please share this post widely with colleagues, authors, lawyers, researchers, professors, and anyone committed to upholding scholarly openness, fiduciary accountability, and digital transparency.
