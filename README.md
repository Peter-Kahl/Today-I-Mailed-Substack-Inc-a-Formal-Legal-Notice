### Abstract
This essay critically evaluates the fiduciary, epistemic, and legal obligations of public-interest organisations, specifically examining the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California’s (ACLU NorCal) policy of limiting case-intake communications exclusively to postal mail. Employing fiduciary theory—particularly Tamar Frankel’s scholarship—and my recent work, Directors’ Epistemic Duties and Fiduciary Openness (2025), the analysis highlights how such restrictive policies constitute explicit breaches of fiduciary duties (openness, fairness, transparency, good faith) and epistemic responsibilities (epistemic openness, epistemic justice). Furthermore, the essay argues that digital inaccessibility violates provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), systematically disadvantaging disabled individuals and other marginalised groups. Through critical analysis of ACLU NorCal’s explicit and implicit institutional commitments, it reveals contradictions between professed values and actual practices, undermining public trust, social cohesion, and democratic legitimacy. The essay concludes with explicit policy recommendations for enhancing digital, multilingual, and international accessibility, alongside governance reforms to ensure ongoing fiduciary and epistemic accountability.
